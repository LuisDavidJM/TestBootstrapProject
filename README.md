## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap Framework

### What I learned

In this page I learned mainly to develop a bootstrap logic to make use of its classes to style the labels, I also learned to use the main actions of bootstrap such as breadcrumbs, slider, alerts, budgets, use of cards, pagination and several more styles like Jumbotron and pop-up windows.

### Continued development

Because it is a template with the bootstrap components, in the future an application can be implemented so that each of the components is used correctly.
